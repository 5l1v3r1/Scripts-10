Misc
====

Random files/scripts that don't belong anywhere else. I am well aware that most of these are probably
buggy and absolutly horrible to look at (no perl though) but they work for the most part and get the
job done. You're more than welcome to try and clean them up for me so I don't have to <3.

* __go_env.sh__


Description
===========

`go_env.sh` Setup a user's __GOPATH__ in an automated fashion because I'm too lazy to keep doing it manually.
