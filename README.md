__`SCRIPTS`__
=======

Random files/scripts that don't belong anywhere else. I am well aware that most of these are probably
buggy and absolutly horrible to look at (no perl though) but they work for the most part and get the
job done. You're more than welcome to try and clean them up for me so I don't have to <3.

* __rfc__


Description
===========

`./GOPATH`: Setup a user's __GOPATH__ in an automated fashion because I'm too lazy to keep doing it manually.

`./mac`: Clone of the laptop script from thoughtbot that __has/will__ be customized to set up a personal environment for development on a fresh __OSX__ installation.

`./rfc`: _rfc_ is a script for __managing/searching/updating__ a local mirror of RFCs from __rfc-editor.org__. All you need is rsync and enough space in `/tmp`. Powered by __Dreams__ and __Pigeons :)__.
